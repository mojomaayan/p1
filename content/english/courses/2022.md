<input type="radio" name="q1"> neither/nor
<input type="radio" name="q1"> also/but

{{< ans >}}
C. Neither/nor. It could have been either/or but it is not one of the options.
{{< /ans >}}

2. {{< tag "aptitude" "Aptitude" >}} A sum of money is to be distributed among P, Q, R, and S in the proportion 5:2:4:3 respectively. If R gets ₹1000 more than S, what is the share of Q (in ₹)?

   
<button id="incorrect", onClick="click_action();"> 500</button>
<button id="incorrect", onClick="click_action();"> 1000</button>
<button id="incorrect", onClick="click_action();"> 1500</button>
<button id="correct", onClick="click_action();"> 2000</button>

   
{{< ans >}}
D. 2000. Expressing as equation, $4x = 3x +1000$, so $x=1000$. So Q got $2x=2000$. Be careful not to stop with finding $x$.
{{< /ans >}}

3. {{< tag "aptitude" "Aptitude" >}} A trapezium has vertices marked as P, Q, R and S (in that order anticlockwise). The side PQ is parallel to side SR. Further, it is given that, PQ = 11 cm, QR = 4 cm, RS = 6 cm and SP = 3 cm. What is the shortest distance between PQ and SR (in cm)?

         
<input type="radio" name="q3"> 1.80
<input type="radio" name="q3"> 2.40
<input type="radio" name="q3"> 4.20
<input type="radio" name="q3"> 5.76

{{< ans >}}
<img src="/images/exams/gate/ece/2022/a3.png" alt="Example image">
Divide the 11 cm segment into $x$ cm, 6 cm, and $5-x$ cm. Write two equations for Pythagoras theorem:
\[
\begin{align*}
h^2+x^2 &= 9\\\
h^2+(5-x)^2 &= 16
\end{align*}
\]
Subracting the equations, $(5-x)^2-x^2=7$, and $25-10x=7$, and $x=1.8$. So $h=\sqrt{9-1.8^2}=2.4$.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<input type="radio" name="q5"> P and Q     
<input type="radio" name="q5"> Q     
<input type="radio" name="q5"> Q and S     
<input type="radio" name="q5"> R and S     

{{< ans >}}
Ans. C. Q and S. Try drawing a line between all pairs of points - if a point hits a boundary, then there is no visibility (line of sight) between the points. For example, a line of sight does not exist between P and R as it hits the boundary. However lines can be drawn from Q and S to every other point without hitting the boundary.
{{< /ans >}}

6. {{< tag "aptitude" "Aptitude" >}} ``` Mosquitoes pose a threat to human health. Controlling mosquitoes using chemicals may have undesired consequences. In Florida, authorities have used genetically modified mosquitoes to control the overall mosquito population. It remains to be seen if this novel approach has unforeseen consequences. ```

Which one of the following is the correct logical inference based on the information in the above passage?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<input type="radio" name="q6"> Using chemicals to kill mosquitoes is better than using genetically modified mosquitoes because genetic engineering is dangerous

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<input type="radio" name="q6"> Using genetically modified mosquitoes is better than using chemicals to kill mosquitoes because they do not have any side-effects

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<input type="radio" name="q6"> Both using genetically modified mosquitoes and chemicals have undesired consequences and can be dangerous

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<input type="radio" name="q6"> Using chemicals to kill mosquitoes may have undesired consequences but it is not clear if using genetically modified mosquitoes has any negative consequence

{{< ans >}}
D. The answer is a restatement of the paragraph.
{{< /ans >}}

7. {{< tag "aptitude" "Aptitude" >}} Consider the following inequalities.
(i) $2x − 1 > 7$
(ii) $2x − 9 < 1$

Which one of the following expressions below satisfies the above two inequalities?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<input type="radio" name="q7"> $x \le − 4$
<input type="radio" name="q7"> $− 4 \le x\le 4$
<input type="radio" name="q7"> $4 < x < 5$
<input type="radio" name="q7"> $x > 5$

{{< ans >}}
C. $2x – 1 > 7\implies x > 4$, and $2x – 9 < 1\implies x < 5$, therefore $4 < x < 5$.
{{< /ans >}}

8. {{< tag "aptitude" "Aptitude" >}} Four points $P(0, 1)$, $Q(0, − 3$, $R(-2, -1)$ and $S(2, − 1)$ represent the vertices of a quadrilateral. What is the area enclosed by the quadrilateral?

         
<input type="radio" name="q8"> 4     
<input type="radio" name="q8">4$\sqrt 2$     
<input type="radio" name="q8"> 8     
<input type="radio" name="q8"> 8$\sqrt{2}$

{{< ans >}}
C. The lengths of the sides can be calculated to be $\sqrt{8}$ each using the distance formula. The slopes of the lines can be calculated using $m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$. For the four lines, the slopes are $\pm 1$. The angle between the lines is $\tan(\theta)=\frac{m_1-m_2}{1+m_1m_2}=\frac{2}{1-1}=\infty\implies \theta=\pi/2$. This proves the figure is a square, so the area is $\sqrt{8}^2=8$.
{{< /ans >}}

9. {{< tag "aptitude" "Aptitude" >}} In a class of five students P, Q, R, S and T, only one student is known to have copied in the exam. The disciplinary committee has investigated the situation and recorded the statements from the students as given below.
     
```
  Statement of P: R has copied in the exam.
  Statement of Q: S has copied in the exam.
  Statement of R: P did not copy in the exam.
  Statement of S: Only one of us is telling the truth.
  Statement of T: R is telling the truth.

<button dcorrect="0" name="q9" class="btn1">  Q </button>
<button dcorrect="0" name="q9" class="btn1">  T </button>

{{< ans >}}
B. We know S speaks truth, and S says only one person speaks the truth, which has to be S himself. So everyone else is a liar and their statements must be inverted. Inverting R's statement, we know P copied in the exam.
{{< /ans >}}

10. {{< tag "aptitude" "Aptitude" >}} Consider the following square with the four corners and the center marked as P, Q, R, S and T respectively. Let X, Y and Z represent the following operations:

Consider a square PQRS and consider how the coordinates change after (1), (2) and (3). With X, PQRS becomes RQPS (interchange of 1 and 3). Y changes PQRS to PSRQ (interchange of 2 and 4). Z changes PQRS to QRSP. Combining these operations, for the sequence of operations (1) and (3) PQRS remains PQRS, and with (2), PQRS becomes RSPQ.
{{< /ans >}}

<input type="radio" name="q11"> 0     
B. 1     
C. 8+2$\pi$     
D. -1

{{< ans >}}
A. 0
      
\[ \oint\limits_{C} \vec{F}(x,y)(\mathrm{d}x \vec i + \mathrm{d} y \vec{j}) = \oint\limits_{C} (x\vec i+ y\vec j)(\mathrm{d}x \vec i + \mathrm{d} y \vec{j}) = \oint\limits_{C}x \mathrm{d}x+y \mathrm{d}y=\int\int \left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial x}{\partial y}\right)\mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}y=0.\]
The last line follows from Green's theorem.

<input type="radio" name="q13"> 1.16 $\times 10^{–3}$ A

{{< ans >}}
B. 0.75 mA. Applying KCL in the first loop, $-5+2I+2(I+1)=0$, so $I$=0.75 mA.

16. {{< tag "ece/ed" "Electronic Devices" >}} Consider a long rectangular bar of direct bandgap $p$-type semiconductor. The equilibrium hole density is $10^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$ and the intrinsic carrier concentration is $10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$. Electron and hole diffusion lengths are 2 $\mu$m and 1 $\mu$m, respectively. The left side of the bar ($x = 0$) is uniformly illuminated with a laser having photon energy greater than the bandgap of the semiconductor. Excess electron-hole pairs are generated ONLY at $x = 0$ because of the laser. The steady state electron density at $x = 0$ is $10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$ due to laser illumination. Under these conditions and ignoring electric field, the closest approximation (among the given options) of the steady state electron density at x = 2 $\mu$ m, is .

      
<input type="radio" name="q16"> 0.37 $\times 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$
<input type="radio" name="q16"> 0.63 $\times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-3}$
<input type="radio" name="q16"> 3.7 $\times 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$

{{< ans >}}
Ans. A. Recall $n_p(x)=n_p(0)e^{-x/l_p}$. Also $np=n_i^2$, so the electron density at $x=0$ is $\frac{10^{20}}{10^{17}}=10^3\ cm^{-3}$. The steady state electron density at x = 2 $\mu$ m, is $10^3+10^14 e^{-2 $\mu$/1 $\mu$}=0.37 $\times 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$.

Assume thermal voltage as 26 mV and the intrinsic carrier concentration is $10^{10}$ cm$^{–3}$ . For $n = 0.5 × 10^{16}$ cm$^{–3}$ , the closest approximation of the value of $E_C – E_{F_n}$, among the given options, is:

{{< ans >}}
Ans. A. $E_c-E_{Fn2}-(E_c-E_{Fn1})=kT\log(\left(\frac{N_C}{N_{d1}}\frac{N_{d2}}{N_c}\right)\implies E_c-E_{Fn2}-200= kT\log(\left(\frac{10^{-16}}{0.5\times 10^{-16}}\right)$=$200+kT\log(2)=218 meV$.

<input type="radio" name="q18"> less than 2 V
<input type="radio" name="q18"> equal to 2 V

C. less than 2 V. Since both MOSFET's are in saturation, the drain currents are equal.
\begin{align}
\frac{\mu_n C_{ox}W}{L}(4-V_0)^2 &= \frac{\mu_p C_{ox}W}{L}(V_0-1)^2,\\\
40 \times 5\times (4-V_0)^2 &= 300(4-V_0)^2,\\\
V_0 &= 1.89 V.
\end{align}
{{< /ans >}}

19. {{< tag "ece/digital" "Digital Electronics" >}} Consider the 2-bit multiplexer (MUX) shown in the figure. For OUTPUT to be the XOR of C and D, the values for $A_0$, $A_1$, $A_2$ and $A_3$ are: ![Example image](/images/exams/gate/ece/2022/q19.png)

<input type="radio" name="q19"> $A_0$ = 0, $A_1$ = 1, $A_2$ = 1, $A_3$ = 0
<input type="radio" name="q19"> $A_0$ = 1, $A_1$ = 1, $A_2$ = 0, $A_3$ = 0

20. {{< tag "ece/ed" "Electronic Devices" >}} The ideal long-channel nMOSFET and pMOSFET devices shown in the circuits have threshold voltages of 1 V and -1 V, respectively. ![Example image](/images/exams/gate/ece/2022/20.png) The MOSFET substrates are connected to their respective sources. Ignore leakage currents and assume that the capacitors are initially discharged. For the applied voltages as shown, the steady state voltages are _________.

    
<input type="radio" name="q20"> V1 = 5V, V2 = 5V
<input type="radio" name="q20"> V1 = 5V, V2 = 4V
<input type="radio" name="q20"> V1 = 4V, V2 = 5V
<input type="radio" name="q20"> V1 = 4V, V2 = – 5V

{{< ans >}}
$_{GS} = V_{DS}$, so MOSFET is in saturation. For channel formation $V_{GS} > V_t$ = 5 – $V_C$ > 1. If capacitor charges than VC will increase at VC = 4 volt VGS = 1 volt. If $V_C > 4V$, channel will deplete out. So $V_C = 4V$, $V_1 = 4V$, $V_{GS} = – 5 – 5 = – 10$, $V_{GS} < –1$, channel is formed. $V_{DS} < V_{GS} – V_t$ for saturation. $V_D < V_G – V_t$,  $V_C < –5 + 1=-4$. The MOSFET will not work in saturation ; MOSFET will work in linear region (always) and current will flow from higher potential to lower potential. So $V_2 = 5V$.

$P$ = Total number of open loop poles, in the right-hand side
$Z = P – N$, $N = -2$, $P = 0$, and $Z = 0 -(– 2) = 2$. Hence two poles lie in right hand side.

22. {{< tag "ece/control" "Control Systems" >}} The root-locus plot of a closed-loop system with unity negative feedback and transfer function $K_G(S)$ in the forward path is shown in the figure. Note that K is varied from $0$ to $\infty$. Select the transfer function $G(S)$ that results in the root-locus plot of the closed-loop system, as shown in the figure. ![Example image](/images/exams/gate/ece/2022/q22.png)

  
{{< ans >}}
As the root locus shows 5 arms going to infinity, so we can say that the root locus consists of 5 poles, all placed at s = –1 as seen from the root locus diagram as we can see from the options that only A satisfies that condition.
{{< /ans >}}

23. {{< tag "ece/sns" "Signals and Systems" >}} The frequency response $H(f)$ of a linear time-invariant system has magnitude as shown in the figure. ![Example image](/images/exams/gate/ece/2022/q23.png)
     
```
Statement I: The system is necessarily a pure delay system for inputs which are band-limited to $-\alpha\le f \le \alpha$
Statement II: For any wide-sense stationary input process with power spectral density $S_X(f)$, the output power spectral density $S_Y(f)$ obeys $S_Y(f) = S_X(f)$ for $-\alpha\le f \le \alpha$.
```
Which one of the following combinations is true?

A. Statement I is correct, Statement II is correct
B. Statement I is correct, Statement II is incorrect
C. Statement I is incorrect, Statement II is correct
D. Statement I is incorrect, Statement II is incorrect

  
{{< ans >}}
A. Statement I is correct, Statement II is correct. For pure delay systems, the frequency response is constant, so statement I is correct. $S_y(f) = |H(f)|^2 S_x(f)$, so statement II is correct.

29. {{< tag "ece/comm" "Communication" >}} Let $H(X)$ denote the entropy of a discrete random variable $X$ taking $K$ possible distinct real values. Which of the following statements is/are necessarily true?

      
A. $H(X) \le \log_2(K)$ bits    
B. $H(X) \le H(2X)$    
C. $H(X) \le H(X^2)$    
D. $H(X) \le H(2^X)$

{{< ans >}}
C. $H(X) \le H(X^2)$.
The entropy is a function of the probability distribution of $X$ and not the values it takes. If $X$ takes $K$ distinct values, the functions $2X$ and $2^X$ also take $K$ distinct values, and the entropy is the same, $H(X)=H(2X)=H(2^X)$, as the probability distribution is unchanged. $H(X) \le \log_2(K)$ bits is true as $\log_2(K)$ is the max entropy possible when the $K$ values are equally likely.
  
$H(X) \le H(X^2)$ may not be true, as negative values of $X$ are also mapped to positive $X^2$ values. To see this consider $X=\{0,-1,1\}$, with the three values equally likely. The entropy is $\log_2(3)=1.58$. $X^2$ takes 0 with probability $1/3$ and 1 with probability 2/3. The entropy is $-2/3\log_2(2/3)-1/3\log_2(1/3)=0.91$.

The circuit element $Z$ can be ________.

     
A. a capacitor of 1 F
B. an inductor of 1 H
C. a capacitor of $\sqrt{3}$ F
D. an inductor of $\sqrt{3}$ H

{{< ans >}}
B. an inductor of 1 H.    
From the figure, $I(t)=\frac{V}{1+Z}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\sin(t-\pi/4)$. The magnitude of $I(t)$ is the ratio of the magnitudes of $V$ and $1+Z$, so $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+|Z|^2}}$, so $|Z|=1$.  The argument of $I(t)$ is the differences in the argument of $V$ and $1+Z$, so $\text{arg}(I)=\text{arg}(V)-\text{arg}(1+Z)$, or $-\pi/4=0-\text{arg}(1+Z)$, $\pi/4=\text{arg}(1+Z)$. Let $Z=x+iy$. From $|Z|=1$, we get $x^2+y^2=1$. Also, $\pi/4=\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{1+x}\right)\implies 1+x=y$. Thus $x^2$+$(x+1)^2$=1, $2x^2+2x=0$, $x=0$ or $x=-1$. $x=-1$ can be ruled out as resistance is non-negative. So, $x=0$ and $y=1$, $Z=j$, which corresponds to an inductor of 1 Henry, $Z=j\omega L$, where $\omega = 1$ rad/s and $L=1$H.

For $c = 1,\ d = -1$, $\lim_{n\to\infty }\frac{1}{c}\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^d=1$, so the ratio test in inconclusive. However, this series is the harmonic series $\sum_n 1/n$ and is divergent.

54. {{< tag "ece/circuits" "Circuits" >}} A linear 2-port network is shown in Fig. (a). An ideal DC voltage source of 10 V is connected across Port 1. A variable resistance $R$ is connected across Port 2. As $R$ is varied, the measured voltage and current at Port 2 is shown in Fig. (b) as a $V_2$ versus $–I_2$ plot. Note that for $V_2 = 5V$, $I_2 = 0$ mA, and for $V_2$ = 4V, $I_2$ = -4 mA.

To avoid calculations, we can use the duality property. If $DFT[x(n)]=X(k)$, $DFT[X[n]]=Nx[-k]$. Thus $DFT[DFT[x[n]]]=Nx[-n]$, so $DFT[DFT[x[0]]]=Nx[0]=8$.

56. {{< tag "ece/ed" "Electronic Devices" >}} A p-type semiconductor with zero electric field is under illumination (low level injection) in steady state condition.  Excess minority carrier density is zero at $x=\pm 2 l_n$, where $l_n=10^{-4}$ cm is the diffusion length of electrons. Assume electronic charge, $q = −1.6 × 10^{-19}$ C. The profiles of photo-generation rate of carriers and the recombination rate of excess minority carriers ($R$) are shown. Under these conditions, the magnitude of the current density due to the photo-generated electrons at $x=\pm 2 l_n$ is  ________ mA/cm$^2$. (rounded off to two decimal places). ![Example image](/images/exams/gate/ece/2022/56.png)


{{< ans >}}
Electron diffusion current density = $eD_n\frac{\partial D}{\partial x}$. Let $\delta_n=\frac{\partial D}{\partial x}=10^{20}\exp(-\frac{|x|}{l_n})\tau_n$, for $0\le x\le l_n, and $\delta_n= 10^{20} \tau_n/e$ for $l_n\le x\le 2l_n. The continuity equation is $D_n \frac{\partial^2 \delta_n}{\partial x^2}=R-G$, where $R$ and $G$ are the recombination and the generation rates. Since $R$ and $G$ are 0 from the figure for $l_n\le x\le 2l_n$, $D_n \frac{\partial^2 \delta_n}{\partial x^2}=0$, so $\delta_n(x)=Ax+b$, for $l_n\le x\le 2l_n$. As $\delta_n(2l_n)=0$, $A=-b/(2l_n)$, and $\delta_n(x)=b(1-x/(2l_n))$.
\br
To find $b$, we already know $\delta_n= 10^{20} \tau_n$ at $x=l_n$, $10^{20} \tau_n/e = b/2$, so $b=2\times 10^{20} \tau_n/e$, and $\delta_n(x)=2\times 10^{20} \tau_n/e(1-x/(2l_n))$. \br
The diffusion current density is $J_n = qD_n \delta_n(x)$ which can be substituted to get 0.59 $mA/cm^2$.

There are only two states to consider. When the diode is ON, the 2$k\Omega$ is shorted, so $\frac{v_{out}}{v_{in}}=\frac{2}{2+2}=0.5$, and when the diode is OFF, the 2$k\Omega$ is in play, and $\frac{v_{out}}{v_{in}}=\frac{4}{4+2}=2/3$. The desired ratio is $\frac{1/2}{2/3}=0.75$.

{{< ans >}}
We assume the three symbols are equiprobable, so $p(x_1)=p(x_2)=p(x_3)=1/3$. $P(y\mid x)=\begin{bmatrix}
1-\alpha & \alpha & 0\\\
0 & 1-\alpha & \alpha\\\
\alpha & 0 & 1-\alpha
\end{bmatrix}$. Using $P(y)=\sum_{i=1}^3P(x_i)P(y\mid x_i)$, we get $P(y_1)=P(y_2)=P(y_3)=1/3$. We want to maximize mutual information $I(X;Y)=H(Y)-H(Y\mid X)$ to find channel capacity, and $H(Y)=\log(3)$ is constant independent of $\alpha$.
\begin{align}
H(Y\mid X) &= \sum_x 1/3 \sum_y -p(y\mid x)\log(p(y\mid x)),\\\
&= -\alpha \log(\alpha)-(1-\alpha) \log(1-\alpha).

{{< ans >}}
Area under $f(x)=1$, so $f(x)=0.25(x+2)$ for $-2\le x \le 0$, and $f(x)=0.5$ for $0\le x\le 2$. We consider the quantization noise for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ separately. For $-2\le x \le 0$, error is $\int_{x=-2}^0 (x-\beta)^2 (0.25)(x+2)\mathrm{d}x=\beta^2/2+2\beta/3-1/3$. For $0\le x\le 2$, error is: $\int_{x=0}^2 (x-\alpha)^2 0.5\mathrm{d}x=\frac{1}{6}\left((1-\alpha)^3+\alpha^3\right)$. To minimize error, we differentiate the two quantities separately: we set $\beta+2/3=0$ and $3\alpha^2=3(1-\alpha)^2$, so $\alpha^{*}=0.5$ and $\beta^*=-2/3$, so $\alpha^* - \beta^* = 7/6$.
